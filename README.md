Skeleton Flamingos!
=========

Just a fun Halloween project to make a small collection of black skeleton flamingos have glowing eyes that light up when you walk past them!

## Code

Pretty straight forward implementation in C on an Atmel AVR attiny2313. Of note may be the 4 channel software PWM routines, though it should work with more channels than that - have not tested beyond that however.
